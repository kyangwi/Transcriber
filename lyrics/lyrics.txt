 So, first question is, how has your school supported teachers in understanding their code of conduct and fulfilling their roles and responsibility.
 Well, in terms of helping teachers
 to understand the code of conduct,
 we have printed out some copies
 of teachers' code of conduct
 and placed at their desk where they can access.
 In fact, the marchers could not give every teacher a copy or copy, but at least we had
 some of you which we gave, they could read one after the other.
 And we have always placed copies in administrators' offices, in case one could do it. Then the other is each time we meet
 them we pass some educative and information which can remind them to
 keep on the standards of teachers conduct. We have also printed out the copies of responsibilities issued to a very teacher, such that it can
 read through and know which role is to be played. Next question is how does your school involve parents and other stakeholders like local
 leaders, community people, religious leaders in making decisions that affect their children's
 life?
 We involve them in meetings.
 We call them in the case of any issue at school, we call them like their representatives, the
 PTA, SMC, chairpersons, and we also welcome parents themselves to come and find out what
 is on the ground.
 We have always received the PTA chair person even addressing the school assembly so that learners
 can give out their views and get positive responses from the parents, the themselves.
 For the borders, we have structured some video days, the visitation days, such that the parents who are far can have time
 to come and meet children who stay at school so that they interact in different ways.
 In case there are some areas which need their attention, they can get them rightly from the children.
 Okay, thank you.
 In which ways does the school ensure teachers' continuous improvement in their practice? In their practice. This can be in teaching.
 Yes. This way, the school administration has gone ahead to supervise them in class, especially
 when they are teaching and also as they assign them other duties, their administrators follow
 up as they keep records and approving their schemes of work, listen to plans and give them guidance where necessary.
 Next, what supports does the school provide teachers
 for their personal well-being, can be emotionally, socially,
 economically, physically and mentally.
 Yes, in fact, much of it can be psychosocial.
 Where interaction comes in, in case the teacher has a challenge which needs help,
 you are within the school, calls the teacher and then they share.
 You also see there are some things which you can share publicly, others can be privately.
 So those which need public attention, I mean private attention,
 we call the teacher and interact.
 How about physically?
 Physically.
 Physically now in which town is it?
 The support in fact, physical has been guided such that
 in fact they can be talked to in the way of appearance, the racing called the word.
 But father, how does your school support teachers and learners to understand, respect and promote child rights?
 Child rights.
 How they teach the learners? How the school supports teachers and learners to understand, respect and promote child rights. First of all, teachers have been recommended to attend some refrigeration training, like
 they have any geos which have taken time to talk about the virus against the children
 and also understanding teachers welfare. Teachers have been involved in those trainings.
 And then they have also provided manuals, materials, reading materials,
 such that they can read and get updated.
 One, to protect the children and also know their rights and how to harm the children.
 So that is how it has been done.
 Okay.
 You must think, in the event that child rights have been violated, how does the school handle the situation?
 Are there structured ways in which the issue is handled?
 The structured ways, it depends on the size of the violence. There are those ones which can be managed at the school level,
 whereby we bring in the senior man to handle it at the school level,
 if it is a child to child issue, but if it goes beyond
 the school level, we structure it to
 police to law. Those ones can now handle what is above the school level. How does your school ensure the safety and protection of learners from sexual abuse, physical harm, child labour and emotional pain? have aim at helping the child to understand how violence affects others, how it can be
 painful either emotionally or physically.
 So in most cases on assembly, peace messages are passed out. Guidance has been always done to make children love the school.
 We call it owning the school as their place being conducive.
 So it has always been done through that and the clubs have been formed. These clubs help children as they interact.
 They also get some knowledge and make their minds updated.
 Physically, we have always worked hard to remove the harmful and hurting objects from the compound so that children can play freely without getting hurt.
 And teachers have been always asked to monitor the plays of children, especially when they
 go to play materials where they might hurt themselves. And the prefix too have been given the responsibility to take
 a watch of the friends when they are coming and report any incidents in case they are school supported, understand and implemented the curriculum. The curriculum, we have encouraged the group scheming.
 As they scheme in groups, they interact and interpret the curriculum. The methods, different methods of teaching have always been introduced to teachers.
 And in this, when they submit their schemes of work, the administrators that we have been using the director of studies and the deputy teacher to approve schemes of work. So when we approving there are some
 areas which need explanation and also addition of information to broaden the
 the scheming, the knowledge of the teacher such that when time comes to teaching of teaching he or she can
 use that knowledge and even father skimming can, person can use that knowledge to interpret
 the curriculum.
 How are the national assessment and curriculum board supported your teaching and improvement
 of the curriculum? and your teaching and improvement, the current year? Yeah, the assessment has worked hard and impacted to opponent the teachers.
 And we have also received some books which have been delivered from the ministry.
 That means that their assessment has found out that there is need for some reading materials to improve and address areas of weaknesses they found on ground.
 And I've also made us to discover where to improve in such that it can come up with better results. Okay. What language support policies and programs are in place to accommodate all learners in school?
 The language...
 What language support policies and programs are in place to accommodate all learners in school. When?
 The language policies.
 Can be around the school, can be in groups,
 to go to portraits of the affected
 communication.
 Can you say, do you mean in message form, display?
 Yes, the message is here.
 Thank you.
 What support policies and programmes it can be some of drama, what can we say?
 Are in place to accommodate all the students in school?
 Yes, well, in the form of the messages, what we have used, in fact, we discourage multi-language, where we have different tribes
 here, but we have encouraged them to use one language that is English language, which can unify them. Because some might come from the two schools
 who might fail to speak the language here
 and then the natives here who might fail to speak the other.
 So we encourage that they use English
 which can unify them and no use of signage
 which can make the child feel out of place.
 And finally, what challenges do you and the teachers face in the teaching and learning process?
 The teaching and learning process? Especially there are some instructional materials which the school might not have.
 But instructional materials, the teaching aids which the school might not have,
 but the curriculum requires you to use. So it means it can and yet it might need someone to touch those which are tangible.
 And now when you try to draw, it doesn't bring out the real picture which you can make,
 you make a child to understand.
 So that is the challenge.
 We have things like the computers which are taught, which need to be taught in the curriculum.
 But when you come on the ground, you may fail to get the exact one which they want in the class for learners to understand better.
 It is just so recent when we are trying to get this power, then maybe we hope better will come.
 So that is the best.
 The main challenge.
 And the other might be to have some teachers, in fact it might be majority, who might not be able to express in local language. And when it comes to assigning duties, allocating subjects,
 you find that there is need for a teacher to go and teach lower P1, P2,
 and of which the curriculum says it should be taught in a local language. So you find that we need to overload some teacher because of that.
 Or we make the teacher to use English. And there are some subjects which need mixing. You mentioned in English, try to code into the local language.
 So if you don't have some vocabulary in the other language, you may work hard to use to calm down
 where even the words might not be good for children.
 So those are basic problems, challenges when we are in class. Oh, perfect.
